## Editing the Wiki


    BEFORE ADDING CONTENT TO THE WIKI, PLEASE READ UP THOROUGHLY ON EXISTING CONTENT TO AVOID DUPLICATED CONTENT!
    please read the Wiki Guidelines & To Do's before contributing.

    æternity is spelled æternity not Æternity, even if it's the beginning of a sentence.

    Please do not change referenced content as it breaks the links

# Wiki Guidelines
The dedicated Wiki channel on Slack is [HERE](https://aeternity.slack.com/messages/C59BALQCE/details/) feel free to join us!

## Before **adding** content:
* read the wiki content, regarding your topic especially thoroughly, before adding any new content (duplicated content will not be counted as wiki bounty)
* Ask in the [Slack Wiki Channel](https://aeternity.slack.com/messages/C59BALQCE/details/) if the content is somewhat meaningful 

## Page translations

**If you translate a page into your language please use the following taxonomy:**

**page title example:** 
- [German]-Titel-der-original-Seite
- [Spanish]-Título-de-la-página-de-origen
- [Italian]-Titolo-della-pagina-di-origine

and so forth.

## Handling of page titles

- **Do not change** the name of the page titles until 30th of May 2017.
This sometimes breaks the commit history (if 'unsupported' characters are contained in the title) by creating a new page.
Some contributors have lost their edits because of this; @zwilla and @DanMercurius accidentally did so, and both are really sorry for that!

## Adding images
* Please open an [issue / ticket](https://github.com/aeternity/wiki/issues)
* Upload Your image, including a short reason & link to the page you want to use it
* Image will be reviewed and approved in a timely manner (24h)

## After **adding** content:
* add the page to the [Navigation Sidebar](_Sidebar.md/) ------>
* if you like you can promote the content on your social media channels

## Markdown & Syntax:
* æternity is spelled æternity **not** Æternity, even if it's the beginning of a sentence.
* even in page titles æternity **not** aeternity should be used.
* you can jump right in and edit if you see a mistake or something that looks weird (these are valid contributions to the wiki bounty)
* make sure you use relative links wherever possible! eg. if you want to refer to the "[[Understanding æternity|Understanding-æternity]]" page, you can use `[[Understanding æternity|Understanding-æternity]]`

**When editing anything, please always comment your changes in the edit message.**

**there has been a misunderstanding:** 

[This page](https://github.com/aeternity/testnet/wiki/Understanding-%C3%A6ternity)
    _contains revisions that are missing in the copied page, that got migrated into the new Repo by accident._
    _Since the migration already happened, we need to somehow import the revision from the above page to here:_

    _[Understanding æternity (in the new wiki repo)](https://github.com/aeternity/wiki/wiki/Understanding-%C3%A6ternity)_
