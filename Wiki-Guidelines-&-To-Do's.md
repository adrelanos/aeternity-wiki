# Wiki Guidelines
The dedicated Wiki channel on Slack is [HERE](https://aeternity.slack.com/messages/C59BALQCE/details/) feel free to join us!

## Before **adding** content:
* read the wiki content, regarding your topic especially thoroughly, before adding any new content (duplicated content will not be counted as wiki bounty)
* Ask in the [Slack Wiki Channel](https://aeternity.slack.com/messages/C59BALQCE/details/) if the content is somewhat meaningful 

## After **adding** content:
* add the page to the [Navigation Sidebar](_Sidebar.md/) ------>
* if you like you can promote the content on your social media channels

## Markdown & Syntax:
* æternity is spelled æternity **not** Æternity, even if it's the beginning of a sentence.
* even in page titles æternity **not** aeternity should be used.
* you can jump right in and edit if you see a mistake or something that looks weird (these are valid contributions to the wiki bounty)
* make sure you use relative links wherever possible! eg. if you want to refer to the "[[Understanding æternity|Understanding-Aeternity]]" page, you can use `[[Understanding æternity|Understanding-Aeternity]]`

**When editing anything, please always comment your changes in the edit message.**
