The blockchain space is growing at an exponential rate each day and there are many players in the space, so how does aeternity compare?

[Another Comparison table](https://github.com/aeternity/testnet/wiki/Blockchain-comparison)

# Bitcoin: 

First mover advantage in cryptocurrency giving it a huge head start but also a first mover disadvantage - it's old technology, no smart contracts, small blocks with slow 10 minute block times. 

æternity is brand new technology on a Lightning Network with smart contracts, oracles & state channels.

# Ethereum: 

Ethereum also has a first mover advantage in the smart contract space and a huge amount of learnings were generated in the first years. æternity is taking these learnings and resolving these issues.

> On Ethereum smart contracts exist on-chain for multiple blocks. They hold state and can interact with other contracts. It only provides a ground layer for smart contracts with no coherent design, no coherent API for web apps, and no naming system or oracles. All these are being built on top of the blockchain.

> On æternity contracts only exists for a moment. They are settled independently of all the other contracts via state channels. This solution makes the blockchain use-cases and throughput more scalable for mainstream adoption and adequate to private use cases.

(Compare with Dapps?) 

# Augur: 

Prediction market based on using the Ethereum decentralized network to create an accurate forecasting tool. 

(Technology used, user base, comparisons) 


# Gnosis:

Futarchy / governance - how this compares. 

dApp on the Ethereum blockchain vs aeternity

Realitykeys external oracle provider intergration

(Comparisons on both to aeternity, i.e. it will use its down blockchain)

# Cosmos:

Communication lines between different blockchains, could be used as a trust-less exchange
