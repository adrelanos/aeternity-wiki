# Types of users, and where they might start

Anyone who wants to store or transfer value, with unparalleled speed, reliability and privacy will be able to use æternity to do so. Everything Bitcoin and Ethereum can do, just got upgraded. Below is a summary of the various user types and how they might start with æternity.

### Contributors:

Contributors can support æternity directly by participating in the [second phase](https://wallet.aeternity.com/) of the contribution campaign or by purchasing AE tokens directly on an exchange once Aeon have been listed in them. To do this, users must first be registered on an exchange where Aeon is trading. Next, the user must have funds available for which to purchase Aeon (likely ETH). Once the transaction is complete, the user can choose storing the AE tokens on the exchange (not recommended) or transfer to a wallet.

In addition, many decentralized applications will be written on top of æternity. Contributors will be able to participate in challenge and cutting edge projects on a most cutting edge blockchain by contributing to their initial coin offerings and/or purchasing their tokens on an exchange. 

### Speculators:

The value of Aeon will be recognized by all forward thinking people. Although we don't endorse it, many people will want to speculate on the potential and price of Aeon. Anyone interested in speculating in æternity are required to be registered on an exchange where AE tokens can be purchased. Typically, speculators purchase assets hoping to make a short-term profit based on anticipate developments in the fundamentals or the emergence of certain profitable trading patterns.
 
### Contract writers & Developers:

Thanks to its unique features (State channels, Decentralized oracles, On-chain Governance, ENS) on top of everything other blockchains have to offer, æternity will be a logical choice for all developers and smart contract writers. It will be the Backbone of the Internet-of-Things.

### Miners:

Miners (Proof-of-Work) will enable them to be rewarded for providing adequate security to the æternity blockchain. The specificity of Cuckoo Cycle algorithm will enable anyone to become a miner, thus achieving great decentralization. Oracle mining (Proof-of-Stake) will be rewarded for providing real world data to the æternity blockchain.
