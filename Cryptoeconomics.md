> I am starting this article with the ambition to present readers (more on the non-technical side) with some history, some forecast and some crypto spice in between it all. Writing this article **is** part of the bountyhunt, but I am not sure if I will be able to finish it. If I do, I will remove this message. If not, eventually the message will be removed once the article is finished, either by other contributors or myself. I hope the structure here will put lots of context for the new kids on the blockchain "block". Also, I by no means **will ever claim** this article is exhaustive enough of the topic/s discussed.

## What/who determines cryptocurrencies prices:

The prices of digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies are greatly influenced by demand and supply. When the demand increases, the price will tend to rise or vice versa. But unlike other markets, cryptocurrency markets have a higher level of volatility as the prices fluctuates frequently.

While demand and supply may seem as the only factors that determines the prices of cryptocurrencies, there are other factors which attributes to the price as well. Speculation is one of those factors. It is fueled by recent press releases, development updates and reputational issues. More often than not, positive news and press releases tend to bring about rise in prices and vice versa. 

Other factors includes the introduction of digital assets in  larger exchange markets with high trading volume, acceptance of digital currencies by more merchants.

*PS: Digital assets are otherwise known as cryptocurrencies.*
